I recently created this site as a place to publish some of my personal basketball analytics projects. Throughout the summer/offseason, I will be focusing on producing more content to share. My goal is to have a wide variety of projects here, such as quick explorations of trends, film breakdowns, coaching analytics, or front office models. This site will always be a work in progress, there is always more to explore, and I feel like no projects are ever truly complete. So, if you're here, check back in for updates!

The structure of the site consists of the following:
- Quick Hitters: Explorations of trends, stats, or other things I found interesting and wanted to take a look at. They might lead to deeper dives, or they might just be a quick look.
- Projects: These are the projects that tend to have a little bit more thought behind them.
- Georgetown Internal Site: I'm working on creating an internal analytics website for Georgetown basketball. If the link does not work for you, it is probably good thing, as access is limited.
