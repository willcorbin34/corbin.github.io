    "This prospect rating method is heavily inspires by Stephen Shea's \"College Prospect Rating 1.0\" from his book \"Basketball Analytics: Spatial Tracking.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is helpful in identifying players that \"the analytics\" like. It can be used as yet another tool in evaluating NBA Draft prospects, but should not be the main source of doing so. For example, this model had Alperen Sengun as the top player in his draft class. This isn't to say that he should've been the number one pick, but maybe indicate that he had more value than people thought and could've been drafted higher than 16th.\n"

    "The logic behind this prospect rating system is that players are proven to get more consistent over time, so we should pay more attention to their best performances rather than the games where they have an off-night. Instead of taking full season averages, we take the average of the player's top 10 performances in many of the stat categories from the 2024-25 season (except 3P%, FT%, and 3PA). \n",
    "\n",
    "I created a function to automatically collect the box score stats (via basketball reference) from the top college players in the 2025 draft class. The most basic stats collected are points, assists, and total rebounds. Offensive rebounds, blocks, and steals serve as an applied athleticism category. 3P%, FT%, and 3PA are our shooting category. Age rating is how many seasons the player played, with some seniors getting a 3.5 instead of a 4 if they are still younger than 23. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is collected, the methodology is as follows:\n",
    "1. Standardize each stat column across all players in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Add up each player's standardized columns to get a raw total.\n",
    "3. Scale to make the raw total positive and to make the differences between player ratings clearer (A ton of players get bunched up in similar ranges, so this adds some separation).\n",
    "4. Scale based on the age rating to penalize the older players who have had more years to gain consistency."
